Special Time notes:

Note A: NORMALSCAN - This is a spacecraft working group request to support
the Cluster mission during conjunctions with the EISCAT radar. All radars should
run a 1-min normalscan (no frequency switching) during this interval.

Note B: THEMISSCAN - This time covers the 'Pulsating Aurora' request (Hosokawa).
All radars should run themisscan during this interval. This mode has a camping beam
which is sounded on every 6 seconds. The scanning scheme is such that the field of
view scan is interleaved with the camping beam.

Note C: RBSPSCAN - This time covers the 'ULF Wave' request (Shi). All radars
should run rbspscan during this interval. This mode consists of a full scan of at
least 16 beams with an interleaved mini-scan of 3 beams, with a scan time of 2-min.
